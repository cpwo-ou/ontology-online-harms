# Ontology Online of Gender-based Harms
## Produced by the Centre for Protecting Women Online - CPWO

The ontology aims to formalise and integrate diverse conceptualisations of online harms, grounded in empirical evidence, stakeholder engagement, and iterative feedback loops.
Led by the Centre for Protecting Women Online (CPWO) it is developed on the grounds of a collaborative and coordinated work across domains and sectors, and provide a reusable resource for researchers, practitioners, and developers aiming to understand, detect, and prevent online gender-based harms.

## Ontology description

- Prefix: ooh
- Namespace: https://purl.org/cpwo/ontology/ooh

The central concept mentioned in the knowledge requirements and therefore, the core class of our ontology is `HarmfulAct`. We adopted a definition of online harms that incorporates at design level law-oriented elements such as `actus reus` and `mens rea`, while including other core classes to capture the knowledge requirements of all the disciplines involved.
For Ontology documentation available [Ontology](ontology).
